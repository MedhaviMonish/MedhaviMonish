# 👋 Medhavi Monish — The AI Blacksmith

Hi, I’m Medhavi — a systems-focused AI builder crafting intelligence from first principles.  
I don’t just train models — I **forge thought**, shape logic, and challenge assumptions.  
Every project here is a blueprint toward reasoning-based AGI.

## 🔩 My Core Projects

| Project | Description | Status |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| 🔧 [CortanaPlusPlus](https://github.com/MedhaviMonish/CortanaPlusPlus) | Custom C++/CUDA ML engine from scratch. No PyTorch. No TensorFlow. Pure control. | 🛠 In Progress |
| 🧠 [RILITH](https://github.com/MedhaviMonish/RILITH) | Reinforcement-Induced Logic in the Thinking Hierarchy — PPO-based AGI reasoning. | 🧪 Design Finalized |
| 🧩 [GreedyContext](https://github.com/MedhaviMonish/GreedyContext) | Compresses LLM input context by tracing the most relevant semantic path. | ✅ Complete |
| 🧬 [TwinSqueeze](https://github.com/MedhaviMonish/TwinSqueeze) | Siamese network for compressing MiniLM embeddings from 384 to ≤64 dims. | ⏳ Not Started |
| 🌐 [Stream-JSON](https://github.com/MedhaviMonish/Stream-JSON) | Real-time parser for partial or token-level JSON/YAML LLM outputs. | ✅ Complete |

## 🧬 The Bigger Vision

I believe AGI won’t emerge from brute-force training — but from agents that learn to **reason**, **remember**, and **survive**.  
My work combines:
- 🧠 **Step-wise RL** instead of token prediction
- 💡 Modular memory, curiosity, and reward models
- 🔁 Ecosystems of small interacting models — not just one monolithic net

These projects are part of that roadmap.

## 🔭 What’s Coming Next
- 🎥 A video showing how I train RILITH using a custom logic-based PPO setup
- 🧪 Dataset generation pipeline + reasoning model walkthrough
- 📓 Google Colab with annotated reward logic and RL charts
