# 👋 Medhavi Monish — The AI Blacksmith [![AI Blacksmith](https://img.shields.io/badge/AI%20Blacksmith-Forging%20Intelligence-blueviolet?style=flat-square)](https://medhavimonish.github.io/)

Hi, I’m Medhavi — a systems-focused AI builder crafting intelligence from first principles.
I don’t just train models — I **forge thought**, shape logic, and challenge assumptions.
Every project here is a blueprint toward reasoning-based AGI.

## 🧬 The Bigger Vision

I believe AGI won’t emerge from brute-force training — but from **ecosystems of AI modules** that learn to **reason**, **remember**, and **survive**.
My work combines:

* 🧠 **Step-wise RL** instead of token prediction
* 💡 Modular memory, curiosity, and reward models
* 🔁 Ecosystems of small interacting **AI modules** — not just one monolithic net

These projects are part of that roadmap.
